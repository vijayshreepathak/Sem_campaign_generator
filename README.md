**How it works:**
1. **Config File** — Defines brand, competitor, filters, and campaign rules.
2. **Keyword Generator** — Expands seed terms and fetches related keywords.
3. **Data Processor** — Cleans, filters, and applies constraints.
4. **Campaign Builder** — Structures search, PMax, and shopping campaigns.
5. **Exporter** — Saves results into Excel/CSV files in `/output`.
